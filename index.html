          <p> Get tough with it, get strong. It's important to me that you're happy. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here.
        </p>
        <p>If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. Let's get wild today. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy.</p>
